/**
 * @brief The Micromouse class encapsulates the core functionality and state management for a micromouse navigating and mapping a maze. It provides methods for setting up sensors, making decisions based on sensor data, moving within the maze, and maintaining an updated map (knownMaze). The class also handles initialization, resetting to initial state, and logging of micromouse activities, facilitating systematic maze exploration and navigation. This modular design supports the implementation of various micromouse algorithms by deriving classes that implement specific decision-making strategies (makeDecision()).
